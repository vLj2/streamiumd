About the Project
=================

This is a port of the great streamium deamon written by Dave Witt from Perl to Python.
It is a music server for the Philips Streamium MC-i250 and MC-i200 and replaces the crappy PC Link windows software shipped with it.

Find the original project on <http://www.witt.tv/streamiumd/> and the description of the streamium protocol on <http://www.siteswap.org/streamium/>.
